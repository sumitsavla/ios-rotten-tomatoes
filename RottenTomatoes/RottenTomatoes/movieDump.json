When a fast-talking guy joins his girlfriend's brother-a hot-tempered cop-to patrol the streets of Atlanta, he gets entangled in the officer's latest case. Now, in order to prove that he deserves his future bride, he must survive the most insane 24 hours of his life. For the past two years, high-school security guard Ben (Hart) has been trying to show decorated APD detective James (Cube) that he's more than just a video-game junkie who's unworthy of James' sister, Angela (Tika Sumpter). When Ben finally gets accepted into the academy, he thinks he's earned the seasoned policeman's respect and asks for his blessing to marry Angela. Knowing that a ride along will demonstrate if Ben has what it takes to take care of his sister, James invites him on a shift designed to scare the hell out of the trainee. But when the wild night leads them to the most notorious criminal in the city, James will find that his new partner's rapid-fire mouth is just as dangerous as the bullets speeding at it. John Leguizamo and Laurence Fishburne join the cast of the action-comedy directed by Tim Story. Ride Along is produced by Will Packer (Think Like a Man), alongside Ice Cube, Matt Alvarez (Barbershop) and Larry Brezner (Good Morning, Vietnam).

Together they seek vengeance upon the treacherous overlord who killed their master and banished their kind. To restore honor to their homeland, the warriors embark upon a quest that challenges them with a series of trials that would destroy ordinary warriors. 47 Ronin is helmed by visionary director Carl Erik Rinsch (The Gift). Inspired by styles as diverse as Miyazaki and Hokusai, Rinsch will bring to life the stunning landscapes and enormous battles that will display the timeless Ronin story to global audiences in a way that's never been seen before. -- (C) Universal","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177853_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177853_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177853_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177853_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Keanu Reeves","id":"162654049","characters":["Kai"]},{"name":"Hiroyuki Sanada","id":"162729305","characters":["Oishi"]},{"name":"Kou Shibasaki","id":"162700180","characters":["Mika"]},{"name":"Tadanobu Asano","id":"162697349","characters":["Lord Kira"]},{"name":"Rinko Kikuchi","id":"545585891","characters":["Witch"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1335975"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/47_ronin/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771218291/similar.json"}}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/dvds/top_rentals.json?limit=10&country=us","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/dvd/top_rentals"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/dvds/top_rentals.json?limit={num-results}&country={country-code}"}
